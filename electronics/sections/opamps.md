# Use of Operational Amplifiers (Op Amps)

An operational amplifier is a "differential" device. That means it takes 2 inputs, measures the difference between them, then outputs this voltage increased by a factor known as "gain". The two inputs of are normally identified as the "inverting" and "non-inverting", indicated on the schematic by "-" and "+" respectively.

An op-amp also requires two different supply voltages to function. Op-amps can be characterised by the power supplies they require, which divides them into 2 groups, single supply, which require a positive supply and ground, and dual supply, which require a positive and negative supply, along with a ground connection. These supplies determine the output range of an op-amp, as it will be unable to exceed these voltages, regardless of its gain. The gain of an op-amp is typically on the order of 100,000. In other words, if the supply were large enough, a 1 mV difference between the inputs would result in a 100V output.

In an analogue circuit, a gain of this magnitude is generally not useful, as the op-amp will saturate for extremely small signals. In an ideal op-amp, saturation means that the output is equal to the supply voltage. However, in the case of a real op-amp, this is normally slightly lower than the supply voltage. A common solution to this problem is to build a "feedback loop". This is where the output of the op-amp is connected back to one of the inputs through a resistor. Several configurations of this are possible, however, in all cases the feedback is used to reduce the gain.

However, In circuits where analogue and digital signals are both present, the saturation of an "open loop" op-amp can sometimes be useful. An "open loop" configuration has no connection between its input and its output. This is the condition under which an op-amps gain is usually measured.

Try building the circuit shown above, connecting the signal generator in place of voltage supply V2. Set the signal generator to produce a sinusoidal output with a peak to peak amplitude of 5 volts and a DC offset of 2.5 volts. 

- What happens if you change the values of R1 and R2?
- What if you were to connect your phototransistor in place of the signal generator?

What do you think is happening here? Do you think that you could use it for your robot?
